### Creating and Running a Job
```
SELECT 
    System.Timestamp AS EndTime,
    dspl AS SensorName,
    Avg(temp) AS Temperature
INTO
   output
FROM
    InputStream
TIMESTAMP BY time
GROUP BY SlidingWindow(second, 30), dspl
HAVING Avg(temp) > 100
```

### Running a More Complex Job
```
telcodatagen 1000 .2 2
```
```
SELECT  System.Timestamp as Time, 
     CS1.CallingIMSI, 
     CS1.CallingNum as CallingNum1, 
     CS2.CallingNum as CallingNum2, 
     CS1.SwitchNum as Switch1, 
     CS2.SwitchNum as Switch2 
 FROM CallStream CS1 TIMESTAMP BY CallRecTime 
     JOIN CallStream CS2 TIMESTAMP BY CallRecTime 
     ON CS1.CallingIMSI = CS2.CallingIMSI 
     AND DATEDIFF(ss, CS1, CS2) BETWEEN 1 AND 5 
 WHERE CS1.SwitchNum != CS2.SwitchNum
 ```
